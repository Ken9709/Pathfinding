# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project was built to experiment with implementation of various pathfinding algorithms

## Available Algorithms

Breadth first search, Depth First Search

### Tech stack

Built using react, and class components with vanilla css. MaterialUI for interaction, etc.

#### Next steps

1. Add weights for Dijkstra and a* (BFS and DFS cannot factor in weights).

2. Improve the UI! And to be able to save paths or things like that on the page without having to reload. A timer would be nice too so you can compare two algos.
3.Diagonal movement for the a* algorithm
